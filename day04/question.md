# --- Day 4: Ceres Search ---
"Looks like the Chief's not here. Next!" One of The Historians pulls out a device and pushes the only button on it. After a brief flash, you recognize the interior of the Ceres monitoring station!<br>

As the search for the Chief continues, a small Elf who lives on the station tugs on your shirt; she'd like to know if you could help her with her word search (your puzzle input). She only has to find one word: XMAS.<br>

This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words. It's a little unusual, though, as you don't merely need to find one instance of XMAS - you need to find all of them. Here are a few ways XMAS might appear, where irrelevant characters have been replaced with .:<br>

<br>
..X...<br>
.SAMX.<br>
.A..A.<br>
XMAS.S<br>
.X....<br>
The actual word search will be full of letters instead. For example:<br>

MMMSXXMASM<br>
MSAMXMSMSA<br>
AMXSXMAAMM<br>
MSAMASMSMX<br>
XMASAMXAMM<br>
XXAMMXXAMA<br>
SMSMSASXSS<br>
SAXAMASAAA<br>
MAMMMXMMMM<br>
MXMXAXMASX<br>
In this word search, XMAS occurs a total of 18 times; here's the same word search again, but where letters not involved in any XMAS have been replaced with .:<br>
<br>
....XXMAS.<br>
.SAMXMS...<br>
...S..A...<br>
..A.A.MS.X<br>
XMASAMX.MM<br>
X.....XA.A<br>
S.S.S.S.SS<br>
.A.A.A.A.A<br>
..M.M.M.MM<br>
.X.X.XMASX<br>
Take a look at the little Elf's word search. How many times does XMAS appear?
